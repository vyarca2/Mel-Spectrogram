# Mel Spectrogram

This repository contains all the programs and scripts needed to generate a mel spectrogram and save the shape to a text file on Google Colab. With suitable modifications, it can be run locally. Each Python program and script is meant to go in its own cell in Colab. Make sure to install Librosa before running these. Replace the path to your audio wherever required.
